# Luck the Manager
The Telegram Channel Managment Bot based on Aiogram the Python lib, and deployed with Heroku.

## How to start?
At first you need to install the aiogram.  
You can do it with the command below:  
<code>pip(pip3) install aiogram</code>  
Or you can install it so (you need to be in the project folder):  
<code>pip(pip3) install -r req.txt</code>

## Instructions
